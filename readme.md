# connor's tex stuff

this repository contains files that I use to ensure consistent structure across my tex documents.

in particular, it does some nice things for me:

- i'm able to move between "minimal" (low ink, black and white) tex documents for printing and colorful, pretty tex documents for viewing digitally.

- i'm able to keep a consistent set of macros and environments across all my projects

- i'm able to easily move __all__ of my quality of life stuff from one class to another using a simple `git clone`.

## ideas
- minimal vs pretty formatting for ink usage

- solution boxes

- title formatting

- theorem/lemma/dfn/etc. formatting

- todo formatting

- ToC

- header for class, name, etc.

- 10pt font

- need to fix counter for minimal formatting

## structure

i've been using the exam class for homeworks, and i will use memoir for notes.

## rebecca turner stuff to take

todo formatting is nice

i like the simplicity of commands
