# connor's tex stuff

this repository will be used to design some consistent structure for my tex documents.

## notes
the current structure of my tex docs is given in "preamble.tex"

i do enjoy this structure, but it is designed mostly for homeworks.

## ideas
- i'd like my tex docs to have colors so that things can be visually distinct. this requires a method of converting color tex docs to b/w docs for printing. in this spirit, there should be two tex structures: a color version, and a b/w version, with some way to transform between the two, although the forward direction is of more pressing importance

- solution boxes

- title formatting

- theorem/lemma/dfn/etc. formatting

- todo formatting

- ToC

- header for class, name, etc.

- 10pt font

- need to fix counter for minimal formatting

## structure

for notes it seems prudent to use the "article" class, while for assignments i will use the "assignments" class.

## rebecca turner stuff to take

todo formatting is nice

i like the simplicity of commands
